# Lab Template

Use this template to structure your READMEs for labs.

Be sure to include a recent [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and Markdown linter
configuration ([`.remarkrc`](.remarkrc)).

## Prerequisites

* Topics with which developers should be familiar with.
* Prerequisites are "just-in-time", so if I have a prerequisite that mentions
  Sass, I would **not** need to include CSS as a prerequisite.
* [Links to previous materials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
  are often useful.
* In a challenge, it is useful to link to reference material, such as talk
  repositories.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Install dependencies.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Please turn in your submission by the deadline on your cohort calendar.

## Requirements

Describe behavioral requirements as you'll be using them in tests. That is,
list requirements in language that describes how the written code will be used,
not how it will be written, with the exception of constraints you may wish to
place on implementation. It's a good idea to include the below paragraph
verbatim.

## Bonus

Bonuses are described after the requirements, if included. They should be worked
on **only after** passing requirements.

Less experienced students should be able to complete the base requirements in
the alloted time for labs and in around 2 hours for homework; more experienced
students should be to complete the bonus.

Sometimes, we ask questions that promote thinking critically about code.

## Plagiarism
