# Build a Responsive Website!

For your first project, you're going to build a responsive website using HTML
and CSS. You'll pick one of a few provided designs and build an honest replica
of it.

## Instructions

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (not GitHub Enterprise).
1. Clone down the repository and complete your work in there.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements below.

Please turn in your submission by the deadline on your cohort calendar.

## Requirements

Pick a design implemented in Adobe XD from the provided collection of designs.

[You can find the designs here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TAwK2keGfuGk6D7UxbDyDWOe-2HVv35a).

**Pick from the `Easy` or `Medium` folders.** Pick something that seems
challenging but manageable!

The goal is to build an accurate clone of your chosen site. Do your best to get
everything looking as similar as possible. Treat it like you were handed this
mockup and given a deadline to deliver it. Use all the available resources
you've been given - documentation, your peers, your instructors, placeholder
images, etc.

Additionally, your site should be responsive (meaning it looks good on mobile,
tablet, and desktop).

Use media queries to rearrange content so that it looks good on different
devices. If your mock only has designs for desktop, then it's up to you to
figure out how to make it look good on mobile. Great! It's really common in the
industry for designers to come up with the desktop designs and then have the
developers figure out the best way to present it on mobile and tablet.

Finally, you should deploy your website to [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This is a free hosting service provided by
GitHub for deploying static websites (no server or database). This is the part
of the project that you get to figure out on your own! ðŸ˜ƒ

In sum, the requirements for this project are:

* Pick a mock and implement it with HTML and CSS
* Make your mock responsive using media queries
* Deploy your website to GitHub Pages

### Helpful Suggestions

Don't spend too much time getting the images exactly right. If you need to, pick
a placeholder stock image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).

Work on the structure first. Don't get stuck in the weeds with details until
you've got most of the high level stuff done. This means start with the
container/row/column pattern and fill them in as you go along.

Try to find the exact font on Google, if you can. Don't pay for a font! Instead,
use Google fonts and try to find a font that is close to the one in the design!
