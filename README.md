# Build a site using Parcel and Bootstrap!

Using your newly learned skills of developing using bootstrap and sass, you'll
pick a website from one of several provided and try to build an honest replica
of it.

## Instructions

1. Create a new project directory on your computer.
1. In that directory, follow the setup from the
   [parcel lesson](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dc-wdi-fundamentals/intro-to-bundlers-parcel)
   to have something to start with.
1. Pick a website to build from the list below.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Please turn in your submission by the deadline on your cohort calendar.

## Requirements

Chose a website from the list of the following websites.

These sites have been chosen because they are a good balance between challenging
and too easy. They are listed in order from generally easier to generally
harder. If you have a strong preference for another site, run it by one of the
instructors first.

The goal is to build an accurate clone of your chosen site. Do your best to get
everything looking as similar as possible. Treat it like you were handed a
mockup and given a deadline to deliver it. Use all the available
resources you've been given - documentation, your peers, your instructors,
placeholder images, etc.

Some of the sites are super long or scroll forever - don't worry about building the whole thing. Pick a couple sections and do those.

When the site is done - congrats! Make a repository and upload it there. See
submission requirements.

## Websites

- https://www.pinterest.com/
- https://www.mcsweeneys.net/
- https://giphy.com/
- https://medium.com/
- https://www.allrecipes.com/
- https://thewirecutter.com/

## Helpful Suggestions

Don't worry about getting exact images, unless you feel like manually
downloading and linking some. That would be awesome to do eventually, but in the
meantime you can use one of several placeholder sites.

```
http://www.fillmurray.com/300/250
https://placehold.it/300x250
https://placekitten.com/300/250
```

All of these will give you a 300x250px image. You can put them directly in the
src attribute.

Super bonus: https://github.com/imsky/holder (but don't waste too much time
getting this working)

---

Use the built in `digital color meter` on your mac to get exact color codes from
the websites. You can copy paste these into sass variables and reuse them!!!

---

Work on the structure first. Don't get stuck in the weeds with details until
you've got most of the high level stuff done. This means start with the
container/row/column pattern and fill them in as you go along.

---

Don't forget about bootstrap's built in components! They are super handy to get
a baseline. You can always customize them.

---

If you use a news site or something with content that updates frequently, take a
screenshot to have something static to work off of. Take a screenshot at 3
different screen sizes!

---

Google fonts is a great resource. You can usually figure out what font a site is
using by inspecting the css and looking for the `font-family` property.

## Submission

- Create a new repository on your github profile
- Commit this site to that repository
- Submit an issue
  [on this very repo](https://git.generalassemb.ly/dc-wdi-fundamentals/build-a-website-parcel-bootstrap/issues)
  with a link to your repository
- Bonus: Include the link to the deployed version as well.

## Bonus

Deploy your site to github pages! The process is the not the same as you did for
your portfolio site, but still pretty easy.

Super hint: You should only deploy what's in `/dist`, not the entire project.
