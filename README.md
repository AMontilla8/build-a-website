of it.

## Instructions

1. Create a new directory.
1. Pick a website to build from the list below.

## Requirements

Chose a website from the list of the following websites and implement it in HTML
and CSS. Your goal is to build a website that looks as close to the image as
possible!

These sites have been chosen because they are a good balance between challenging
and easy. They also have plcaes where you'll be able to practice the things
we've learned, like media queries, flexbox, and csss grid.

The goal is to build an accurate clone of your chosen site. Do your best to get
everything looking as similar as possible. Treat it like you were handed this
mockup and given a deadline to deliver it. Use all the available resources

### Helpful Suggestions

Don't worry about getting exact images, unless you feel like manually
downloading and linking some. That would be awesome to do eventually, but in the
meantime you can use one of several placeholder sites:

* https://unsplash.com/
* http://www.fillmurray.com/300/250
* https://placehold.it/300x250
* https://placekitten.com/300/250

Use the built in `digital color meter` on your mac to get exact color codes from
the websites.

Work on the structure first. Don't get stuck in the weeds with details until
you've got most of the high level stuff done. This means start with the
container/row/column pattern and fill them in as you go along.

Google fonts is a great resource for fonts. Try to find a fond that is close!

## Bonus

Deploy your site to github pages!
