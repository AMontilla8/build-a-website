# Build a Responsive Website!

For your first project, you're going to build a responsive website using HTML
and CSS. You'll research and pick a design for a website and build an honest
replica of it.

## Instructions

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (not GitHub Enterprise).
1. Clone down the repository and complete your work in there.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements below.

Please turn in your submission by the deadline on your cohort calendar.

## Requirements

Spend some time researching and looking for a design for a website. The best
places to find designs are:

* https://dribbble.com/
* https://www.pinterest.com/
* https://www.behance.net

You want to pick something that will be challenging, but not require too much
flourish. Pick something that seems challenging but manageable! Ask your
instructors for feedback on your mock!

The goal is to build an accurate clone of your chosen site. Do your best to get
everything looking as similar as possible. Treat it like you were handed this
mockup and given a deadline to deliver it. Use all the available resources
you've been given - documentation, your peers, your instructors, placeholder
images, etc.

Additionally, your site should be responsive (meaning it looks good on mobile,
tablet, and desktop). Use media queries to rearrange content so that it looks
good on different devices. If your mock only has designs for desktop, then it's
up to you to figure out how to make it look good on mobile. Great! It's really
common in the industry for designers to come up with the desktop designs and
then have the developers figure out the best way to present it on mobile and
tablet.

Finally, you should deploy your website to [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This is a free hosting service provided by
GitHub for deploying static websites (no server or database). This is the part
of the project that you get to figure out on your own! ðŸ˜ƒ

### Helpful Suggestions

Don't worry about getting exact images, unless you feel like manually
downloading and linking some. That would be awesome to do eventually, but in the
meantime you can use one of several placeholder sites:

* https://unsplash.com/
* http://www.fillmurray.com/300/250
* https://placehold.it/300x250
* https://placekitten.com/300/250

Use the built in `digital color meter` on your mac to get exact color codes from
the websites.

Work on the structure first. Don't get stuck in the weeds with details until
you've got most of the high level stuff done. This means start with the
container/row/column pattern and fill them in as you go along.

Google fonts is a great resource for fonts. Try to find a fond that is close to
the one in the design!
